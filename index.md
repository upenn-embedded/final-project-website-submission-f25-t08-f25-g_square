## Final Project Report


### 1. Video

[Insert final project video here]

* The video must demonstrate your key functionality.
* The video must be 5 minutes or less.
* Ensure your video link is accessible to the teaching team. Unlisted YouTube videos or Google Drive uploads with SEAS account access work well.
* Points will be removed if the audio quality is poor - say, if you filmed your video in a noisy electrical engineering lab.

### 2. Images

[Insert final project images here]

*Include photos of your device from a few angles. If you have a casework, show both the exterior and interior (where the good EE bits are!).*

### 3. Results

*What were your results? Namely, what was the final solution/design to your problem?*

#### 3.1 Software Requirements Specification (SRS) Results

*Based on your quantified system performance, comment on how you achieved or fell short of your expected requirements.*

*Did your requirements change? If so, why? Failing to meet a requirement is acceptable; understanding the reason why is critical!*

*Validate at least two requirements, showing how you tested and your proof of work (videos, images, logic analyzer/oscilloscope captures, etc.).*

| SRS-01 | The IMU 3-axis acceleration will be measured with 16-bit depth every 100 milliseconds +/-10 milliseconds. | Confirmed, logged output from the MCU is saved to "validation" folder in GitHub repository. |

#### 3.2 Hardware Requirements Specification (HRS) Results

*Based on your quantified system performance, comment on how you achieved or fell short of your expected requirements.*

*Did your requirements change? If so, why? Failing to meet a requirement is acceptable; understanding the reason why is critical!*

*Validate at least two requirements, showing how you tested and your proof of work (videos, images, logic analyzer/oscilloscope captures, etc.).*

| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| HRS-01 | A distance sensor shall be used for obstacle detection. The sensor shall detect obstacles at a maximum distance of at least 10 cm. | Confirmed, sensed obstacles up to 15cm. Video in "validation" folder, shows tape measure and logged output to terminal. |
|        |                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                         |

### 4. Conclusion

Reflect on your project. Some questions to address:

* What did you learn from it?
* What went well?
* What accomplishments are you proud of?
* What did you learn/gain from this experience?
* Did you have to change your approach?
* What could have been done differently?
* Did you encounter obstacles that you didn’t anticipate?
* What could be a next step for this project?
